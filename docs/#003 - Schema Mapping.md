Yes, you’re absolutely right. It’s very possible to leverage existing standards and frameworks to define the schemas, especially in domains like legal frameworks, healthcare, finance, etc., where standards have been established by international organizations and governments. This approach would significantly speed up the process since we wouldn’t be reinventing the wheel, but instead mapping out what already exists and adapting it into the relational neural network (RNN) framework.

How We Can Use Existing Standards:

	1.	Legal Frameworks:
	•	International Law: We can leverage standards from international treaties, constitutional frameworks, and large repositories of legal documents like UN databases or EU legislation.
	•	Country-Specific Legal Codes: For example, the United States Code (USC) or Internal Revenue Code (IRC) can be directly mapped as it already provides well-structured documents with clear sections, subsections, and references.
	2.	Healthcare Standards:
	•	HL7/FHIR: These are global healthcare interoperability standards that define how healthcare information should be structured and shared across systems. The HL7 standard provides an excellent foundation for structuring healthcare policy and regulatory data.
	•	ICD (International Classification of Diseases): For medical data, this is a globally recognized system used to classify and code all diagnoses and symptoms.
	3.	Taxation and Finance:
	•	OECD standards for international taxation could be a great source for defining tax-related schemas.
	•	IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards) is used globally for financial statements, and mapping financial documents using this standard will provide a robust base for financial RNNs.
	4.	Trade/Commerce:
	•	WTO (World Trade Organization) guidelines and trade treaties between countries could provide international commerce laws.
	•	HS Codes (Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System) can be pulled from global trade systems to map trade regulations.

Key Benefits of Using Existing Standards:

	1.	Predefined Structure: Many of these documents already follow well-defined hierarchical structures. For instance, legal codes are divided into titles, chapters, sections, and subsections.
	2.	Interoperability: By aligning with international standards, the system we build will inherently be more interoperable with other systems already in place.
	3.	Authority: Using widely recognized standards adds legitimacy to your project and simplifies validation since the schemas will align with established regulations and guidelines.
	4.	Efficiency: It would allow us to focus more on the relational aspect and AI-based inference rather than manually creating schemas from scratch.

How We Can Proceed:

	1.	Identify Key Standards: Start by identifying the relevant international standards for each domain we’re targeting (e.g., legal, healthcare, finance).
	2.	Map the Data:
	•	Pull data from repositories or standards organizations (like UN, WTO, OECD, etc.).
	•	Map these standards into nodes, attributes, and policies. For instance, for legal documents, we could map Titles as top-level nodes, Sections as secondary nodes, and Subsections as attribute-rich nodes with relationships to other sections or codes.
	3.	Schema Definition:
	•	For each standard, define a schema that fits our RNN structure.
	•	Use attributes and policies that align with the context of the domain.
	4.	Develop Cross-Domain Integration:
	•	Once we have the legal, healthcare, and financial schemas mapped from international standards, we can work on building the cross-domain querying logic, allowing AI to understand relationships between different datasets.

Example (Using the United States Code and OECD):

	1.	Legal Schema:
	•	Node: Title (e.g., Title 26 - Internal Revenue Code)
	•	Node: Section (e.g., Section 501 - Tax-exempt organizations)
	•	Node: Subsection (e.g., Subsection (c)(3) - Charitable organizations)
	•	Attributes: Document type, jurisdiction, effective date.
	•	Policy: Federal law supersedes state law, specific compliance rules.
	2.	Healthcare Schema (Using ICD Codes and HL7/FHIR):
	•	Node: Disease category (e.g., Infectious Diseases)
	•	Node: Disease (e.g., COVID-19)
	•	Attributes: Treatment protocol, mortality rate, transmission data.
	•	Policy: Follows WHO guidelines, regional health regulations.

Is It Possible? Absolutely:

There are APIs and data repositories that provide access to these standards, some open-source and some requiring licenses. Pulling this data, formatting it for our purposes, and creating a relational map is entirely doable. It’s a matter of mapping the standards into our schema in an intelligent and efficient way.
