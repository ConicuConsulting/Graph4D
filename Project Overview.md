	•	Explanation of RNNs (how they combine attributes, policies, and relationships)
	•	Real-world use cases (e.g., OpenEye legal framework)
	•	Comparison to traditional graph databases and relational databases
	•	Detailed workflow of how nodes, attributes, and policies interact
	•	Cross-domain queries and interactions
	•	Scalability of RNNs in multi-domain environments

6. LegalFrameworkExample.md (OpenEye Use Case for Legal Framework)

Purpose: A real-world example showing how OpenEye leverages the RNN framework to map legal documents and policies. This will be helpful for anyone interested in understanding how to use the framework for legal or governmental use cases.

Content:

	•	Description of a specific legal document (e.g., Internal Revenue Code)
	•	How sections and clauses are structured into nodes
	•	How attributes (e.g., jurisdiction, precedence) are applied
	•	How policies (e.g., amendment, compliance) govern the relationships
	•	Example of querying the legal framework

7. API_Documentation.md (API Reference for RNN Querying)

Purpose: Provides an overview of the API calls available for interacting with the RNN framework, including how to query nodes, attributes, and relationships.

Content:

	•	Query language overview (e.g., Node.policy, Node.attribute)
	•	API endpoints for querying relationships between nodes
	•	Examples of cross-domain queries
	•	Authentication and access control mechanisms
	•	Rate limits and performance considerations

8. FutureRoadmap.md (Future Development Plan)

Purpose: Outlines the future plans for the project, including both the immediate next steps and long-term vision for expansion.

Content:

	•	Next steps for OpenEye (e.g., improving legal data coverage, adding new domains)
	•	Next steps for RNNs (e.g., building out healthcare and financial modules)
	•	Potential new features (e.g., attribute caching, performance optimization)
	•	Open issues and challenges
	•	Timeline and milestones

9. Contribution_Guidelines.md (How to Contribute)

Purpose: Guides contributors on how they can contribute to the project, from writing code to submitting documentation.

Content:

	•	Code contribution guidelines (e.g., code formatting, testing)
	•	How to submit pull requests
	•	Examples of areas where contributions are needed (e.g., domain-specific schemas)
	•	Documentation guidelines
	•	Licensing and contributor agreements

10. LICENSE.md (Project Licensing)

Purpose: This document defines the legal licensing for your project. It is essential to protect your work and clarify how others can use or contribute to the project.

Content:

	•	Define licensing (e.g., MIT, GPL)
	•	Usage restrictions (if any)
	•	Open-source contributions and credits

11. Glossary.md (Key Terminology)

Purpose: Helps users understand the specific terms and concepts used throughout the project, especially useful for newcomers or contributors from outside the domain.

Content:

	•	Definitions of Nodes, Attributes, Policies, Relationships, Domains
	•	Key terms used in OpenEye and RNN Framework
	•	Common technical terms (e.g., Cross-Domain Queries, API Calls, Precedence)

File Structure Example

Here’s how you might organize these files in your repository:

/root
│
├── README.md
